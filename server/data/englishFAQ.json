        "question": "My account is frozen due to 'risk control', what should I do?",
        "answer": "### What is risk control (wind control) and why is risk control triggered?\nEnsuring the security of users' capital accounts is the top priority of CoinHome. Risk control is an additional technical measure to ensure the security of user accounts. If there is a suspicious login or abnormality in the user account, the account will be locked to ensure the security of the account funds. The platform will identify accounts in an abnormal state through technical means. Risk control may be triggered if your account usage involves the following situations:\n\n- Your IP is from a country or region that CoinHome does not support transactions;\n- You have frequently logged in to multiple accounts on one device;\n- Your identity verification country/region does not match your daily active range;\n- In order to participate in CoinHome activities, register accounts in batches;\n- The account was suspected of violating regulations and was frozen due to the request of the judicial authority to assist in the investigation;\n- Your account conducts frequent large-value transactions and withdrawals within a short period of time;\n- Your account is operated on a suspicious device or IP, and there is a risk of being stolen;\n- Other risk control reasons.\n\n### If my account triggers certain risk control measures by mistake, how to release the risk control?\nIf your account is incorrectly triggered due to improper operation, you can contact customer service and follow the process specified by customer service/risk control to unlock the self-service account. The platform will review it within 3 to 7 working days. Please wait patiently.\n\nIn addition, please change your password in time and ensure that your email, mobile phone, or Google Authenticator and other security verification methods are secure and accessible only by yourself. You can also contact the customer service team for further support. However, please note that if you are unlocked for risk control reasons, you need to provide sufficient supporting documents to ensure your ownership of the account. If you fail to provide materials, submit documents that do not meet the requirements, or do not meet the reasons for the appeal, you will not be able to receive timely support.\n\n**Please note ⚠️:** Fraudulent phone calls/text messages from counterfeit CoinHome staff have been prevalent recently. If you have any doubts about the received emails/text messages, you can confirm the authenticity of the email and website through the verification channel of the CoinHome official community customer service. You can use the CoinHome online customer service system to obtain further support. If you have any questions about funds, please consult customer service as soon as possible.

Users can send their **BTC** assets to the **Segwit (bech32)** address. For more information, see **What is a SegWit Address?**\n\nUnder some mainnets, when users share a mainnet (such as **BEP2** or **EOS**, etc.), you must fill in the memo information to identify your transfer address. Please note that whether you choose to deposit or withdraw coins to a third-party platform or to your digital wallet, you need to ensure that:\n\n- **Wallet/platform compatibility:** Ensure support for the network; if the target platform does not support your currency withdrawal network, the assets will not be retrieved.\n- **Matching networks:** The network for your deposit and withdrawal is the same as the target platform; if you choose the target address to be the Ethereum network but choose Binance Smart Chain for deposit, you may not be able to retrieve your digital assets.\n- **Check your details:** Make sure your address and amount are correct before depositing or withdrawing coins.\n\nSince the blockchain network is anonymous and private, once you enter incorrect information, you will lose the corresponding assets.

        "question": "What is a market order?",
        "answer": "Market orders allow you to place an immediate buy or sell order for an asset at the best current market price. You can choose **[Quantity]** or **[Transaction Amount]** to place a buy or sell market order. For example, if you want to buy a certain amount of **BTC**, you can directly enter the amount. But if you want to buy **BTC** with a certain amount, such as **10,000 USDT**, you can use **[Transaction Amount]** to place a buy order."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a limit order?",
        "answer": "There are two main types of orders when trading cryptocurrencies: market orders and limit orders. A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset immediately at the market's current price, while a limit order is an order to be executed when a specific price or better is reached. A limit order is an order placed in an order book at a specific limit price. It will not be executed immediately like a market order. Instead, a limit order will only be executed when the market price reaches your limit price (or better). Therefore, you can use a limit order to buy an asset at a lower price or to sell it at a price higher than the current market price.\n\nFor example, you place a buy limit order for 1 **BTC** at **$60,000**, and the current **BTC** price is **$50,000**. Your limit order will be filled immediately at **$50,000**, which is more ideal than the price you set (**$60,000**). Similarly, if you place a sell limit order for 1 **BTC** at **$40,000** and the current **BTC** price is **$50,000**, the order will fill immediately at **$50,000**, which is more desirable than **$40,000**.\n\n**Comparison: Market order vs. Limit order**\n- **Market order:** Buy assets at market price. Deal now. Manual operation.\n- **Limit order:** Buy an asset at a set price or a better price. Only when the limit order or better price is reached can the transaction be completed. Can be set in advance."

        "question": "What is Market Order?",
        "answer": "There are two main types of orders when trading cryptocurrencies: market orders and limit orders. A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset immediately at the market's current price, while a limit order is an order to be executed when a specific price or better is reached. The market order will be executed as soon as possible at the current market price after the user places the order. When placing a market order, you can choose **[Quantity]** or **[Transaction Amount]** to buy or sell. For example, if you want to buy or sell **Bitcoin** with a certain amount, it is recommended to select **[Quantity]**. However, if you want to buy **Bitcoin** with a certain amount of funds, such as **10,000 USDT**, it is a better choice to place a market order using **[Transaction Amount]**. Typically, you can use these two functions to place buy and sell orders. However, if you place an order after the system calculates the amount you can get, the asset price may change significantly, and the amount of assets you get from this order may have some differences from the amount calculated before placing the order. In some special cases, the order may fail to be placed. Usually, this happens when the buy/sell ratio is close to or equal to 100%.\n\n**Market order example**\n\nThe current price is **2,400**. If you place a market order, your order will be filled with the best available price on the order book immediately. The average filled price of your order may not be exactly **2,400**; it could be slightly below or above **2,400**."

        "answer": "### According to the transaction volume:\nSuppose you have **1,000 USDT** and want to place a market order for **BTC/USDT**. After placing the 'buy 100%' order, the system will execute the order at the current market price according to the amount of **USDT** you own, but it cannot determine how much **Bitcoin** you can buy. The final **Bitcoin** transaction amount is determined by the market price and quantity at the time the order is placed. You can check the amount and average price of **Bitcoin** you bought in **[Order History]**.\n\n### According to the quantity:\nFor example, you have **100,000 USDT**, and the price of **BTC/USDT** fluctuates around **34,105 USDT**. When you place a 'buy 100%' order, the system matches your order with sell orders in the market to determine how much **Bitcoin** you can buy. If the system calculates that you can buy **0.41154** bitcoins with **10,000 USDT**, you enter the purchase quantity as **0.41154** bitcoins and click to place a buy order. However, if at the same time the price of **Bitcoin** rises, **10,000 USDT** can no longer buy **0.41154** bitcoins, your order will fail to buy. You can manually edit the amount of **Bitcoins** you want to buy to place another order, or use **[Transaction Amount]**."

The **USDT** amount to sell this **0.41166 Bitcoin** will be determined by the current market price and quantity when you place the order.
